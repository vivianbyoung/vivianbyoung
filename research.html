	<h2>Accuracy and Precision in Marker-based Motion Capture</h2>
	<p>
		Abstract:
		<br>One of the biggest challenges in marker-based motion capture is maintaining accuracy and precision. The prominence of this issue is due to the common method of placing markers by hand, the reliance on anatomical landmarks, and soft tissue artifacts. The resulting error in the data translates kinematically, which may lead to faulty results and conclusions. However, accuracy and precision can be improved by determining an appropriate motion capture model to use, using marker placement devices, or by utilizing medical imaging. By compiling information from studies and literature in the motion capture field, this thesis provides an overview of sources of error and how to combat error in marker-based motion capture and may act as an introductory resource to these topics. In addition, this thesis presents preliminary validation testing that was performed on a marker replacement device.

	<h2>Investigating the stress response to caging, prey switching, & feeding frequency in the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina)</h2>
	<p>
		Introduction:
		<br>As climate change progresses, the potential for it to impact marine mammals grows, specifically its impact on prey sources for aquatic carnivores like the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Harbor seals are opportunistic predators; their stomach contents have been shown to include pacific herring, walleye pollock, and various cephalopods species. As ocean temperatures warm due to global warming, the effects could be highly detrimental to populations of harbor seals, which have been steadily declining in recent decades. Ocean warming can cause prey species to shift locations northerly, therefore reducing the potential for harbor seals to utilize that prey source. In response, harbor seals may either expend more energy searching for that prey or switch to a different prey source, one which may not be as nutritionally beneficial. In addition, human endeavors such as commercial fishing have been reducing the overall abundance of prey available to harbor seals. As a result, glucocorticoid levels may rise and the overall health of the animal may be reduced due to nutritional stress. The purpose of this study was to examine the viability of using fecal glucocorticoids, specifically cortisol levels, for analysis, as well as its response to: 1) the effects of caging subjects during the 72-hour sampling period, 2) the effects of prey switching between lipid-rich pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) & lipid-poor walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) versus mixing diets, and 3) the effects of feeding frequency (high vs. low).
