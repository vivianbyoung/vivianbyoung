		<br>I'm a versatile and adaptive problem-solver who has found myself wearing many different hats during my emerging career. I'm a mechanical engineer by education, with a transition into the tech field.
		<br>
		<br>I've analyzed data at a corporate office and animal hormones in a biology research lab. I've written code for an artificial intelligence tool and a fifty-page thesis about motion capture. I've worked as a people manager for craft employees in a field environment and as a product manager for a web application. I've volunteered with Vietnam War veterans and high school students.
		<br>
		<br>Through it all, I have gained valuable technical and interpersonal skills that have fostered my development as an engineer, leader, and human being. I have a wide breadth of passions, interests, and experiences, and I'm always striving for opportunities to learn, grow, and make an impact!
