	<h2>Enhancing Positron-Emission Tomography Images with Deep Learning Methods</h2>
	<p>
		<br>• Acted as the programming lead for a team project on examining medical images through AI machine learning algorithms
		<br>• Programmed tools in Python using Tensorflow and Keras that allowed for the identification of tumors in MRI 3D brain scan images through a convolutional neural network and U-Net
		<br>
		<br>Introduction:
		<br>Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging process that utilizes radiation. Increased radiation results in higher resolution images that help identify abnormalities such as cancerous tumors. However, high doses of radiation can be dangerous to the patient’s health and safety. This project aimed to detect abnormalities in PET images with low-dose radiation. Using sample MRI 3D brain scan data, the team developed a program that was able to achieve 90% accuracy in the identification of tumors with 39.44 hours of training, using a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Graphics Card. This program can be applied to other data sets like PET images to get similar results.
